### Tech

- Python3
- CSV

## TODO

- [ ] Refactor to class
- [ ] write function with algorithm I created to find Prime columns
- [ ] Write primes to csv instead of generating each time/ also incrementally create primes as they get larger
- [ ] FUnction to calculate rows/range
- [ ] Try to optimize prime search

---

## Data to collect/track

- [ ] Chart, headers prime/subprime rows with col lengths for comparison
- [ ] Create Cols 1-9 for comaprison
- [ ] larger then nine, digital root of cols.
- [ ] distribution down cols

### Data to track per grid

- [ ] Num of Columns
- [ ] Range, eg 1-20000
- [ ] Distribution of prime vs subprime cols
- [ ] distribution toris cols (1,2,4,5,7,8)
- [ ] distribution of digital roots

---

### Possible Tech

- Flask (visual representation, website)
- Pandas

## About this project

### Interesting Discoveries !!!

- Primes Never have a digit root of [3, 6, 9]
- Digit roots of [1,2,4,5,7,8] seem to be fairly equal in distribution
- I can Calculate which Columns Primes show up in on any Width graph size
- Specific widths, primes only show up in Prime and Subprime Numbered columns (divisible 3,6,9) <--- More testing needed to confirm
